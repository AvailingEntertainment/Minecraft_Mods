Project: NoNameYet
Version: 0.1 (00128)

This mod aims to add more things to do in Minecraft. After playing Minecraft for a long time now
i've grown bored of the same old thing over and over again; this mod's goal is to fix that bordom!

When the mod is complete I want to have the following completed:
	6 new ores to find and mine,
	4 New mobs to hunt in the night and day!
	2 1/2 additional armor sets,
	2 extra sets of tools,
	more food and generating structures.
	
Currently Completed
	6 new ores (no gfx)
